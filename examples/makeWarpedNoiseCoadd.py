  - pathToExposure is the path to an Exposure;
    only the WCS and image size are used from the exposure; all other data is ignored.
  - the first exposure listed is taken to be the reference exposure;
    all other images are warped to match its WCS.
  - empty lines and lines that start with # are ignored.

Make a chi-squared coadd from a set of warped Gaussian noise images.
The WCSs for the Gaussian images are taken from a list of input images
(which are only used for their WCS).
The intent is to see how correlated noise affects the statistics of a pure noise coadd.
